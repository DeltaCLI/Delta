# Delta CLI User Guide

## Introduction

Delta CLI (âˆ†) is an intelligent command-line tool that enhances your terminal experience with AI-powered features, memory capabilities, and advanced command management. This guide will walk you through all the features and commands available in Delta CLI.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Delta CLI can be installed using the provided installation script:

```bash
make install
```

This will install the `delta` binary to `/usr/local/bin/delta`.

### Basic Usage

Once installed, you can start Delta CLI by simply typing:

```bash
delta
```

You'll see the Delta CLI prompt:

```
Welcome to Delta! ðŸ”¼

[deltacli] âˆ† 
```

### Command Syntax

Delta CLI supports two types of commands:

1. **Shell Commands**: Any regular shell command works in Delta CLI just like in your normal terminal.
2. **Internal Commands**: These start with a colon (`:`) and provide Delta-specific functionality.

Example:
```
[deltacli] âˆ† ls -la                 # Regular shell command
[deltacli] âˆ† :help                  # Delta internal command
```

## Core Features

### AI Assistant

Delta's AI assistant can predict and suggest commands based on your usage patterns.

```
[deltacli] âˆ† :ai                    # Show AI status
[deltacli] âˆ† :ai on                 # Enable AI features
[deltacli] âˆ† :ai off                # Disable AI features
[deltacli] âˆ† :ai model <name>       # Change the AI model
[deltacli] âˆ† :ai status             # Show detailed AI status
[deltacli] âˆ† :ai feedback <type>    # Provide feedback on suggestions
```

### Jump Navigation

Quickly navigate to commonly used directories:

```
[deltacli] âˆ† :jump add <name> [path]   # Add a location
[deltacli] âˆ† :jump <name>              # Jump to a saved location
[deltacli] âˆ† :jump list                # List all saved locations
[deltacli] âˆ† :jump remove <name>       # Remove a location
[deltacli] âˆ† :j <name>                 # Shorthand for jump
```

```

## Advanced Usage

### Command Completion

Delta CLI supports tab completion for both shell commands and internal Delta commands. Simply press the Tab key to see available options.

### History Navigation

Press Up and Down arrow keys to navigate through your command history.

### Command Suggestions

When enabled, Delta will automatically suggest commands based on your history:

```
[deltacli] âˆ† git status
[Suggestion: git push]
```

### Command Correction

If you make a typo in a command, Delta will suggest corrections:

```
[deltacli] âˆ† :inferense
Unknown command: :inferense
Did you mean ':inference'?
```

### Context-Aware Suggestions

Delta analyzes your current directory and recent commands to provide context-aware suggestions:

```
[project/backend] âˆ† npm start
[deltacli] âˆ† 
[Suggestion: npm test]
```

## Configuration

### Configuration Files

Delta CLI stores its configuration in the following locations:

```
~/.config/delta/                      # Main config directory
â”œâ”€â”€ system_config.json                # System-wide configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ memory/                           # Memory data
â”œâ”€â”€ memory_config.json                # Memory configuration
â””â”€â”€ history/                          # History analysis data
```

### Environment Variables

Delta CLI respects the following environment variables:

- `DELTA_CONFIG_DIR`: Override the default config directory
- `DELTA_DISABLE_AI`: Disable AI features if set
- `DELTA_MODEL`: Specify the default AI model

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI features not working**:
   - Ensure Ollama is installed and running
   - Check that the selected model is available

2. **Memory system errors**:
   - Check disk space and permissions on `~/.config/delta/`
   - Try running `:memory clear` to reset the memory system

3. **Performance issues**:
   - Disable heavy components like vector database if experiencing slowness
   - Use `:config edit` to adjust resource usage settings

### Getting Help

For additional help, use the `:help` command or consult the detailed documentation by running:

```
[deltacli] âˆ† :help <command>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Jump Locations**: Add frequently visited directories to jump locations for quick navigation.

2. **Provide Feedback**: Use `:feedback` to improve AI predictions.

3. **Organize Knowledge**: Use `:knowledge scan` in project directories to build a knowledge base.

4. **Create Agents**: Use agents for repetitive tasks in your workflow.

5. **Export Your Config**: Regularly export your configuration with `:config export` for backup.

## Privacy

Delta CLI is designed with privacy in mind:

- Command history is stored locally only
- Sensitive commands with passwords, API keys, etc. are filtered out
- All AI processing happens locally (when using local models)
- You can use `:memory config` to adjust privacy filters

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Agents

Create specialized agents for your workflow:

```
[deltacli] âˆ† :agent create "BuildAndTest"
[deltacli] âˆ† :agent edit BuildAndTest
```

### Knowledge Management

Manage project-specific knowledge:

```
[deltacli] âˆ† :knowledge project import <path>
[deltacli] âˆ† :knowledge project export <path>
```

### Training Custom Models

Delta supports training custom models on your command history:

```
[deltacli] âˆ† :memory train start
```

This will launch a training job in Docker (requires Docker to be installed).

## Conclusion

Delta CLI is designed to enhance your terminal experience with AI-powered features while respecting your privacy and workflow. As you use Delta CLI more, it will learn your patterns and become increasingly helpful.
