# Delta CLI v0.4.3-alpha Release Notes

## 🌍 Enhanced Internationalization with Secure Downloads

This release improves the internationalization (i18n) system with GitHub release-based translation downloads and SHA256 checksum verification for enhanced security.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔒 Secure Translation Downloads
- **SHA256 Checksum Verification**: All downloaded translation files are now verified against SHA256 checksums for security
- **Separate i18n Archives**: Translation files are packaged separately in releases as `delta-i18n-{version}.tar.gz`
- **deltacli.com API Integration**: Uses deltacli.com API for version checking instead of GitHub API
- **Automatic Verification**: Downloads and verifies checksums before installing translations

#### 📦 Improved i18n Commands
- **`:i18n download`**: Download all translations with checksum verification
- **`:i18n update`**: Update translations to the latest version
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear troubleshooting tips when downloads fail

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Release Process
- Release script now creates separate `delta-i18n-{version}.tar.gz` archives
- Checksums include i18n archives for verification
- Smaller download sizes (only ~100KB for translations vs full source)

#### Security Enhancements
- Downloads `checksums.sha256` from releases
- Verifies SHA256 hash matches before installation
- Fails gracefully if verification fails
- No GitHub tokens required (uses public release URLs)

### 📝 Usage

When running Delta outside the source directory:

```bash
# Download translations with verification
:i18n download

# Update to latest translations
:i18n update

# Check current locale
:i18n locale
```

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed i18n loading when running Delta outside source directory
- Improved error handling for network issues
- Better fallback to built-in English translations

### 📊 Statistics
- Supported Languages: 11 (en, es, fr, it, nl, zh-CN, de, pt, ru, ja, ko)
- Download Size: ~100KB (translations only)
- Verification: SHA256 checksum for all downloads

### 🔄 Upgrade Instructions

1. Download the appropriate binary for your platform
2. Run `:i18n download` to get the latest translations
3. Translations will be installed to `~/.config/delta/i18n/locales`
