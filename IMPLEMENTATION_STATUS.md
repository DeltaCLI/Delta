# Delta Memory and Learning System: Implementation Status

This document provides a summary of the current implementation status for Delta's memory and learning capabilities.

## Completed Milestones

### Milestone 1: Command Collection Infrastructure ✓
We've successfully implemented a memory system that:
- Collects and stores command history with context
- Uses binary file format with daily shards
- Implements privacy filtering for sensitive commands
- Provides detailed statistics and data management
- Exposes a user-friendly command interface (`:memory`)

### Milestone 2: Terminal-Specific Tokenization ✓
We've implemented a tokenization system that:
- Processes raw commands into training-ready data
- Uses specialized tokenization for shell commands
- Manages a vocabulary for efficient token representation
- Stores tokenized data in a binary format
- Provides testing and visualization tools (`:tokenizer`)

### Milestone 3: Docker Training Environment ✓
We've created a containerized training environment that:
- Supports single and multi-GPU training with PyTorch
- Implements efficient data loading and preprocessing
- Provides both single-GPU and distributed training modes
- Uses advanced features like mixed precision and gradient accumulation
- Automatically scales to available hardware
- Integrates with Delta's memory system

## In Progress

### Milestone 4: Basic Learning Capabilities
Currently working on:
- Implementing core learning commands for user feedback
- Developing training data extraction API
- Creating evaluation framework for model quality
- Adding model deployment pipeline

## Future Milestones

### Milestone 5: Model Inference Optimization
- Implement speculative decoding for faster responses
- Add ONNX Runtime integration for optimized inference
- Create continuous batching system for throughput

### Milestone 6: Advanced Memory & Knowledge Storage
- Add vector database for semantic command search
- Implement embedding generation for commands
- Create knowledge extraction from command context

### Milestone 7: Full System Integration
- Complete end-to-end integration
- Provide comprehensive configuration
- Create detailed user documentation
