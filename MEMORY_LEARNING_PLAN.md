# Delta CLI Memory and Learning System Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for Delta CLI's memory and learning capabilities. The goal is to make Delta more intelligent over time by collecting, analyzing, and learning from command history.

## Overview

The memory and learning system consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Memory Manager**: Collects and stores command history safely
2. **Tokenization System**: Processes raw commands into training data
3. **Training Pipeline**: Trains models on collected command data
4. **Inference System**: Uses trained models to provide intelligent assistance

## Memory System Design

### Core Components

1. **MemoryManager**: Manages the collection and storage of command history.
   ```go
   type MemoryManager struct {
       config         MemoryConfig
       configPath     string
       storagePath    string
       currentShard   string
       prevCommand    string
       shardWriter    *os.File
       shardWriteLock sync.Mutex
       isInitialized  bool
   }
   ```

2. **CommandEntry**: Represents a single command execution with context.
   ```go
   type CommandEntry struct {
       Command     string
       Directory   string
       Timestamp   time.Time
       ExitCode    int
       Duration    int64
       Environment map[string]string
       PrevCommand string
       NextCommand string
   }
   ```

### Storage Architecture

- Daily shard files (binary format with length-prefixed JSON)
- Configuration stored in JSON format
- Organized directory structure under ~/.config/delta/memory/
- Privacy filters to exclude sensitive commands

### User Interface

- `:memory` and `:mem` commands with subcommands:
  - `enable/disable`: Toggle memory collection
  - `status`: Show current status
  - `stats`: Display detailed statistics
  - `config`: View/update configuration
  - `list`: List available data shards
  - `export`: Export data for a specific date
  - `clear`: Delete all collected data
  - `train`: Training-related commands

## Learning System Design

### Tokenization System

- Custom tokenizer for terminal commands
- Special handling for paths, variables, and command structures
- Preprocessing pipeline for normalization
- Binary storage format for tokenized data

### Training Pipeline

- Docker-based training environment
- Multi-GPU support with PyTorch DDP
- Support for both fresh training and fine-tuning
- Automated model evaluation
- Nightly training schedule

### Inference Optimization

- Speculative decoding for faster responses
- Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for efficiency
- Continuous batching for high throughput
- ONNX Runtime integration for performance

## Integration Strategy

The memory and learning system is designed to seamlessly integrate with Delta's existing architecture:

1. **Command Execution Flow**:
   ```
   User Input -> Command Processing -> Command Execution -> Memory Collection
                                                            |
                                                            v
   AI Prediction <- Memory Retrieval <- Learning System <- Storage
   ```

2. **AI Integration**:
   - Memory data feeds into AI predictions
   - AI predictions improve based on collected data
   - User feedback refines AI behavior

3. **User Experience**:
   - Minimal performance impact
   - Privacy-conscious by default
   - Opt-in learning features
   - Transparent operation

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **Technical Metrics**:
   - Command processing speed (<1ms overhead)
   - Storage efficiency (<1KB per command)
   - Training time (relative to baseline)
   - Inference latency (<10ms)

2. **Learning Quality Metrics**:
   - Prediction accuracy improvement over time
   - User correction rate reduction
   - User feedback scores

## Security and Privacy Considerations

1. **Data Protection**:
   - Local-only storage by default
   - Sensitive command filtering
   - Configuration for data retention

2. **User Control**:
   - Opt-in memory collection
   - Clear data command
   - Configurable privacy filters

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Milestone 2: Terminal-Specific Tokenization
2. Develop a proof-of-concept tokenizer for terminal commands
3. Create a detailed specification for the training data format
4. Update implementation milestones as we progress

This memory and learning system will transform Delta CLI from a simple shell wrapper into an intelligent assistant that understands and adapts to the user's command-line workflow.
