- Improved command discovery by scanning PATH directories

### Signal Handling Improvement (2025-05-10)
- Fixed signal handling for interactive terminal applications like htop
- Changed subprocess execution to allow Ctrl+C to be passed directly to child processes
- Removed separate process group creation for commands
- Implemented proper signal handler reset/restore cycle during command execution
- Fixed issue where Delta would exit if Ctrl+C was used in a subprocess like htop
- Added dedicated signal channel for subprocess execution
- Implemented proper cleanup of signal handlers after command completion
- Added isolation between main shell signals and subprocess signals

### Shell Functions and Aliases Support (2025-05-10)
- Added proper support for shell functions and aliases in zsh
- Implemented specialized shell script generation for different shells (bash, zsh, fish)
- Fixed issue with shell profile loading (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc.)
- Improved detection and execution of shell functions and aliases
- Reorganized command execution logic for better maintainability

## Current Tasks

### AI Integration (In Progress)
