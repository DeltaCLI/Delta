# Milestone 4: Basic Learning Capabilities

## Implementation Summary

Milestone 4 focused on completing the integration of the learning system with the AI manager, allowing the Delta CLI to learn from user feedback and improve its predictions over time.

### Key Components Implemented

1. **Enhanced AI Manager Integration**
   - Added custom model support in AI manager
   - Integrated feedback collection with AI thoughts
   - Implemented automatic feedback collection for relevant predictions
   - Added better context tracking for feedback collection
   - Enhanced prompt generation with feedback examples

2. **Improved Feedback Collection**
   - Added more user-friendly feedback display
   - Implemented multi-word correction support
   - Added feedback statistics and training status information
   - Enhanced feedback validation with timestamp checking

3. **Custom Model Support**
   - Added ability to switch between Ollama and custom models
   - Implemented custom model path resolution and validation
   - Added model management commands

4. **Inference Manager Initialization**
   - Integrated inference manager into CLI startup
   - Added automatic detection of custom models
   - Added notification for pending training

### Command Interface

The following commands were implemented or enhanced:

1. **AI Commands**
   - `:ai feedback <helpful|unhelpful|correction> [correction]` - Provide feedback on the last prediction
   - `:ai model custom <path>` - Use a custom trained model
   - `:ai model <model_name>` - Switch to a specific Ollama model
   - `:ai status` - Show detailed AI status with learning information

2. **Inference Commands**
   - `:inference enable/disable` - Enable or disable the learning system
   - `:inference feedback <type> [correction]` - Provide feedback on predictions
   - `:inference stats` - Show detailed statistics about collected feedback
   - `:inference examples` - Show training examples derived from feedback
   - `:inference model use <path>` - Use a custom trained model

### Files Modified

1. **ai_manager.go**
   - Enhanced with feedback tracking and learning system integration
   - Added custom model support
   - Improved prompt generation with examples from feedback

2. **inference.go**
   - Implemented the core inference and feedback management system
   - Added configuration management for learning settings
   - Implemented training example generation from feedback

3. **inference_commands.go**
   - Implemented CLI commands for the inference system
   - Added user-friendly feedback collection interface
   - Implemented model management commands

4. **cli.go**
   - Added inference manager initialization
   - Enhanced AI commands with learning capabilities
   - Integrated feedback commands

## How to Use

### Providing Feedback

After seeing an AI prediction, you can provide feedback using:

```
:feedback helpful          # Mark the prediction as helpful
:feedback unhelpful        # Mark the prediction as unhelpful
:feedback correction "This would be a better prediction"
```

Or use the longer form:

```
:inference feedback helpful
:inference feedback unhelpful
:inference feedback correction "This would be a better prediction"
```

### Training

When enough feedback has been collected, you can start training:

```
:memory train start
```

### Using a Custom Model

After training, you can use the custom model:

```
:ai model custom /path/to/model.onnx
```

## Next Steps

1. **Vector Database Integration** - Implement vector database for semantic search of command history
2. **Advanced Inference Optimization** - Implement speculative decoding and continuous batching
3. **Model Evaluation Metrics** - Add comprehensive evaluation for trained models
4. **Multiple Training Strategies** - Implement different training strategies for different use cases
5. **End-to-End Verification** - Implement comprehensive testing of the learning system

These improvements will further enhance the learning capabilities of Delta CLI in future milestones.
