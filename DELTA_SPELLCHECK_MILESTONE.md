# Delta CLI Spell Checker - Milestone 8

## Overview
Implement a spell checking system for Delta CLI that detects and suggests corrections for misspelled commands. The system will catch common typos in internal commands and provide helpful suggestions to improve user experience.

## Motivation
Currently, when users make typos in Delta CLI commands (e.g., `:interfence` instead of `:inference`), they receive a generic "Unknown command" error. A spell checking system would provide helpful suggestions, improving usability and reducing frustration.

## Core Components

### 1. Command Typo Detection
- Implement a fuzzy matching algorithm to detect potential typos in command input
- Focus on internal commands that start with colon (`:`)
- Calculate edit distance between entered command and known commands
- Set appropriate thresholds for suggestion confidence

### 2. Suggestion Generation
- Generate and rank potential corrections based on:
  - Edit distance (Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, or Jaro-Winkler)
  - Common typo patterns (transpositions, insertions, deletions)
  - Command usage frequency
- Only suggest corrections with high confidence

### 3. User Interface
- Display suggestions when a command is not found
- Format: "Unknown command: `:interfence`. Did you mean `:inference`?"
- Support for multiple suggestions if applicable
- Option to execute suggested command directly

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Efficient implementation with minimal performance impact
- Pre-compute or cache common commands and their variations
- Only check commands that aren't recognized

### 5. Configuration Options
- Enable/disable spell checking
- Configure suggestion threshold
- Option to automatically execute high-confidence corrections
- Add custom dictionary entries

## Implementation Files
- `spellcheck.go`: Core spell checking implementation
- `spellcheck_commands.go`: Command handling for spell checker configuration
- Updates to `cli.go`: Integration with command processing

## Technical Requirements
- Implement lightweight fuzzy matching algorithms
- Maintain a list of all valid commands and subcommands
- Add configuration options in the existing config system
- Fallback mechanism for when suggestions aren't confident

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully detects common typos in internal commands
2. Provides appropriate suggestions for misspelled commands
3. Handles edge cases gracefully (partial commands, very incorrect input)
4. Minimal performance impact on command processing
5. User-friendly configuration options

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for edit distance algorithms
- Test suite with common typos for each command
- Integration tests for suggestion generation
- Performance benchmarks

## Timeline Estimate
- Implementation: 3-5 days
- Testing and optimization: 2-3 days
- Documentation and examples: 1-2 days
