# Jump Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the jump directory navigation feature in DeltaCLI, which provides similar functionality to the external `jump.sh` script but implemented natively within the CLI.

## Files Added

1. **jump_manager.go**: Main implementation of the JumpManager type and related functions
   - Manages jump locations (add, remove, list)
   - Handles persistent storage in ~/.config/delta/jump_locations.json
   - Imports locations from external jump.sh script

2. **jump_helper.go**: Helper functions that integrate jump_manager.go with the CLI
   - Provides handler functions to connect CLI commands with JumpManager
   - Keeps concerns separated for better code organization

3. **JUMP.md**: Documentation for the jump feature
   - Describes usage and features
   - Provides examples

4. **jump_manager_test.go**: Tests for the JumpManager functionality

## Implementation Details

### Storage

- Jump locations are stored in a JSON file at `~/.config/delta/jump_locations.json`
- The format is a simple map of location names to paths

### Core Functionality

- **JumpManager**: Manages the collection of saved locations
- **handleJumpCommand**: Entry point for CLI commands
- **jump.sh Import**: Automatically extracts locations from existing jump.sh

### CLI Integration

- The DeltaCLI handles both internal `:jump` commands and overrides the external `jump` command
- Tab completion is provided for jump locations
- Help text includes jump command information

## Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Jump functionality is isolated in its own files
   - Clear interfaces between CLI and jump manager

2. **Configuration Directory**:
   - Uses ~/.config/delta/ following XDG Base Directory specification
   - Falls back to home directory if .config cannot be created

3. **Minimal Dependencies**:
   - Uses only standard library packages
   - No external dependencies

4. **User Experience**:
   - Command syntax matches external jump.sh
   - Tab completion for better usability
   - Helpful error messages

## Future Improvements

1. **Customizable Locations**:
   - Allow specifying a different jump.sh to import from
   - Support for team-shared locations

2. **Enhanced Navigation**:
   - Jump to parent/child locations
   - Jump with pattern matching

3. **Statistics**:
   - Track frequently used locations
   - Suggest locations based on usage patterns

### Working Directory Tracking

To complement the jump functionality, DeltaCLI also provides built-in directory navigation with:

1. **cd command**: Changes the current working directory within DeltaCLI
   - Supports absolute and relative paths
   - Handles home directory with `~` and `~/path` syntax
   - Falls back to home directory when no arguments provided

2. **pwd command**: Displays the current working directory

3. **Directory in prompt**: The current directory is shown in the prompt to provide context
   - Format: `[directory_name] âˆ† `
   - Home directory is represented with `~` for brevity
